# About
The reason why this is called "codeday-team" is because I don't have a name for it yet, and I was developing it for/at CodeDay.  I'll rename when we find a name for it.

# Live Version
Thanks to @virtualdxs, we now have a live version here: http://box.k7dxs.xyz/

Please don't reuse a password on the site though, because it is for testing and may not be secure. Also, the page is sent via HTTP and is not encrypted.
