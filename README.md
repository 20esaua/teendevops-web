# About
The reason why this is called "codeday-team" is because I don't have a name for it yet, and I was developing it for/at CodeDay.  I'll rename when we find a name for it.

# Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Import the schema called `codeday-team.sql` into your SQL server
3. Rename `config.php.example` in the `includes/` folder to `config.php`
4. Configure your site
5. ???
6. Profit
